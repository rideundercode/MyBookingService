## GitLab configuration settings
##! This file is generated during initial installation and **is not** modified
##! during upgrades.
##! Check out the latest version of this file to know about the different
##! settings that can be configured, when they were introduced and why:
##! https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blame/master/files/gitlab-config-template/gitlab.rb.template

##! Locally, the complete template corresponding to the installed version can be found at:
##! /opt/gitlab/etc/gitlab.rb.template

##! You can run `gitlab-ctl diff-config` to compare the contents of the current gitlab.rb with
##! the gitlab.rb.template from the currently running version.

##! You can run `gitlab-ctl show-config` to display the configuration that will be generated by
##! running `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`

##! In general, the values specified here should reflect what the default value of the attribute will be.
##! There are instances where this behavior is not possible or desired. For example, when providing passwords,
##! or connecting to third party services.
##! In those instances, we endeavour to provide an example configuration.

## GitLab URL
##! URL on which GitLab will be reachable.
##! For more details on configuring external_url see:
##! https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/configuration.html#configuring-the-external-url-for-gitlab
##!
##! Note: During installation/upgrades, the value of the environment variable
##! EXTERNAL_URL will be used to populate/replace this value.
##! On AWS EC2 instances, we also attempt to fetch the public hostname/IP
##! address from AWS. For more details, see:
##! https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html
external_url '{{ gitlab_external }}'

## Roles for multi-instance GitLab
##! The default is to have no roles enabled, which results in GitLab running as an all-in-one instance.
##! Options:
##!   redis_sentinel_role redis_master_role redis_replica_role geo_primary_role geo_secondary_role
##!   postgres_role consul_role application_role monitoring_role
##! For more details on each role, see:
##! https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/roles/README.html#roles
##!
# roles ['redis_sentinel_role', 'redis_master_role']
